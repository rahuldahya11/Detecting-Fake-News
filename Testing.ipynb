      "\n",
      "With his role as King T'Challa in the boundary-breaking film \"Black Panther,\" he became a global icon and an inspiring symbol of Black power. That role was the \"honor of (Boseman's) career,\" the statement said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Boseman returned to his alma mater in 2018 to give the commencement speech . He told the graduates about his early days acting on soap operas, saying he was fired from an unnamed production after he questioned what he felt was its stereotypical portrayal of Black characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The struggles along the way are only meant to shape you for your purpose,\" he said at the time.\n",
      "\n",
